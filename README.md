- Hello! I'm Nick. I'm currently a student in the Master of Applied Data Science program at University of Michigan.
- I'm interested in all things data! Once I graduate, I'd like to work in the education sector where I can explore data driven solutions for students.
- I'll be posting some of my class projects on here. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project!
